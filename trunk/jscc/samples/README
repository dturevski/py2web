These are the two example parsers coming with JS/CC, in various versions.

To compile them, use the JS/CC port of your platform and call it with

	<jscc> -o <output> -t ../driver_<platform>.js <input>

e. g.

	rhino ../jscc.js -o xpl.js -t ../driver_rhino.js xpl.par

will do it for the Rhino version of the XPL interpreter. You can then run the
interpreter by typing something like

	rhino xpl.js xpl/99-bottles-of-beer.xpl

The examples within this directory are for various platforms, but each example
is not covered for each platform because of different methods and limitations
for i/o operations. Adapt the example for your platform by using an existing
one. Using the jscript-variants is the easiers way, here you only need so
search for "WScript" and rewrite the particular calls.

calc_jscript.par            - Command-line calculator for JScript (WSH)
calc.par                    - Command-line calculator for
                              Rhino/Spidermonkey/V8
calc_web.par                - Web-based interactive calculator embedded on a
                              website
xpl_jscript.par             - XPL compiler/interpreter for JScript (WSH)
xpl.opt_jscript.par         - XPL compiler/interpreter for JScript (WSH), in
                              an optimized version with lesser grammar code
xpl.par                     - XPL compiler/interpreter for Rhino only

In the directory "xpl", you can also find some examples to be executed using
the XPL compiler/interpreter.
